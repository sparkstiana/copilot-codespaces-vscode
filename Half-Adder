In this project, you'll construct a half adder using an XOR gate and an AND gate. The inputs will be
controlled with switches or pushbuttons. The outputs should be connected to LEDs to easily observe
their states.
What is Half-Adder
Internally the half adder can be implemented as a combinational logic circuit, so we can also describe
it with a truth table.
